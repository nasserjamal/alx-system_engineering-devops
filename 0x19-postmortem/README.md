## Root Cause & Resolution

The root cause of the issue was a server configuration error that caused high CPU usage. The setting related to the number of worker processes in our web server was set too high for the available resources, leading to a slowdown in performance and partial outage. The issue was resolved by reducing the number of worker processes to a more appropriate value, allowing the server to handle incoming requests effectively 💻💥.

## Corrective & Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will regularly review server configurations to ensure they are optimized for available resources, implement automated monitoring and alerting to quickly detect and respond to performance issues, establish a clear escalation process for incidents involving multiple teams, and provide regular training to on-call engineers 🤓.

### Tasks

- Review server configurations on a monthly basis 📅.
- Implement automated monitoring and alerting for server performance 🚨.
- Document the escalation process for incidents involving multiple teams 📝.
- Provide regular training sessions for on-call engineers 💻🤓.

## Conclusion

The outage was caused by a server configuration error, and was resolved by adjusting the server configuration. To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will regularly review server configurations, implement monitoring and alerting, establish a clear escalation process, and provide regular training 💻💥💃.
